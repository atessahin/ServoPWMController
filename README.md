STM32F411E-DISCO Servo Motor Control Project

This project  how to control a servo motor using the STM32F411E-DISCO development board with the STM32Cube HAL library. The code is written in C and compiled using the Keil IDE. The servo motor is controlled via a PWM signal generated by TIM2, allowing smooth movement between 0°, 90°, and 180°, as well as a sweeping motion from 0° to 180° and back.

Features

Servo motor control using TIM2 PWM on STM32F411E-DISCO

Smooth sweeping motion between 0° and 180°

Angle positioning at 0°, 90°, and 180°

Configurable PWM signal for precise control

Requirements

Hardware:

STM32F411E-DISCO development board

Servo motor

Software:

Keil uVision IDE

STM32Cube HAL library

Hardware Setup

Connect the servo motor signal pin to PA2 on the STM32F411E-DISCO board.

Connect the servo motor power and ground pins to the respective power supply. Ensure the servo motor's voltage requirements match the power source.

If necessary, use an external power supply for the servo motor and connect the ground of the STM32F411E-DISCO to the ground of the external power supply.

Code Description

PWM Configuration

The TIM2 timer is configured to generate a PWM signal on channel 3 (PA2).

A 50Hz PWM signal is generated (20ms period), with the pulse width varying from 0.5ms to 2.5ms to control the servo angle.

GPIO Configuration

PA2 is configured as an alternate function (TIM2_CH3) for PWM output.

Servo Control Logic

The servo motor sweeps from 0° to 180° in increments of 50µs pulse width.

After reaching 180°, it sweeps back to 0°.

The servo also moves to positions (0°, 90°, 180°).

Usage

Open the project in Keil uVision IDE.

Compile and flash the code to the STM32F411E-DISCO board.

Power the board and the servo motor.

Observe the servo motor moving as per the programmed logic:

Sweeping motion from 0° to 180° and back.

Angle movements to 0°, 90°, and 180°.

Check the Keil project settings to ensure the correct device is selected.
